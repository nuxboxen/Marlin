#               Choose a Path 

**PATH 1  Give me a firmware.bin so I can leave**
**PATH 2  Hey i want to tweek and recompile my own**
**PATH 3  I'm smarter then you Nux you deserve pain**

#             PATH 1  (GIVE ME THE .BIN FILE!)

Ok ok,  all you need to do is download the .zip file from
the page you are currently on.  Scroll up a little and find
the Green Button that says "Code" click the button and choose
the bottom option "Download ZIP"  and save that zip file
like you would any other downloaded file.   Open the zip and
move SKR-EZABL-firmware.bin to your printers SDCard and rename
it to firmware.bin.  Insert SDCard in you printer, power up and 
the printer will replace it's firmware with the one you just added
by itself.  

*Note: If on first boot you see an error about EEPROM not matching
that is not a problem.  Use the menu to reset to "factory defaults"
(don't worry it's just clearing a few settings from your old setup)
then choose "store settings" and the EEprom is ready to go.*

You're up and running the new firmware now:  you can finish setting
up the probe offsets, I recomment the video below for a good guide
to all the steps you'll need to do after the firmware flash, just
ignore their firmware flashing it doesn't work with the skr boards.
[*Skip to 19:40* The Edge Of Tech EZABL howto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dYBvPl6wkU)

Please Realise:  Because this is a .bin file you've downloaded
                 and flashed you are stuck with alot of choices 
                 that I made for you.  There are still lots of
                 options you can set through m codes and the
                 control menus but some of the deeper options 
                 of the firmware can't be changed at this point.
                 If you need to do some of those type of changes
                 you're going to have to follow path 2 and 
                 complile a .bin yourself.

#             PATH 2  (LET'S COMPILE A BIN FILE!!!)             

**Tools Needed:  VSCODE with PlatfromIO IDE extension**
The main tool you'll need to compile this code is Visual Studio Code, here's
[the official Visual Studio Code Download Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  Once
you have VSCode installed and running you'll see a icon on the right side tool bar that
looks like four little squares (Extensions) click the Icon and search for "PlatformIO IDE"
and install the extension.  That's it, don't even bother with the "Auto Build Marlin" extension
I've already configured the files so you don't need it, it's more likely to confuse the situation
then help.

**Ok my Tools are ready... what next?**  Look for the green "Code" button near the top 
of this page, click it and choose the bottom option "Download ZIP" and save the zip file.

**EXTRACT the files from the zip file**  we can't work with the files if they are in the 
zip file, so you'll need to extract a copy of the files to some location on your computer.

**Start VSCode;  Choose OPEN FOLDER**  and choose "Marlin-bugfix-2.0.x" folder that you
just extracted from the zip file.

**You're Ready!**  at this point you're already setup to build the firmware, all you would
need to do is click the little checkmark in the bottom blue bar and the build would start
and when it completed you'd find your new firmware at .pio/build/STM32F103RC_btt_512K/firmware.bin

**Yeah but I to comfigure something different then what you have**  Sounds fun, have at it...
to make changes to the firmware you'll need to make changes in the Marlin/Configuration.h and
Marlin Configuration_adv.h those files are fairly well documented with comments within the files
themselves, if you need more info on a feature just give it a google.  

**What is SKR-EZABL-TITAN-Nuxs-Personal-Configuration.h ?**  pretty self explanitory... that's
my personal configuration as I have a geared extruder which needs a few firmware tweeks itself.
Don't worry it won't be used when you build your firmware as long as you leave the names like
they are,  the build only uses Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h but you're welcome to
take a look.






#             PATH 3  (I'M WAY SMARTER THEN YOU NUX)

Hey congratulations on your achievments in life, sorry this project seems
so elementary but it works.  If we ever cross paths I'll buy you lunch and
have a hundred questions for you.

## Marlin 2.0 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.0.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin 2.0 introduces a layer of abstraction so that all the existing high-level code can be built for 32-bit platforms while still retaining full 8-bit AVR compatibility. Retaining AVR compatibility and a single code-base is important to us, because we want to make sure that features and patches get as much testing and attention as possible, and that all platforms always benefit from the latest improvements.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
